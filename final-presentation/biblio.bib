%%% abstract="In this paper, we demonstrate how different forms of background knowledge can be integrated with an inductive method for generating function-free Horn clause rules. Furthermore, we evaluate, both theoretically and empirically, the effect that these forms of knowledge have on the cost and accuracy of learning. Lastly, we demonstrate that a hybrid explanation-based and inductive learning method can advantageously use an approximate domain theory, even when this theory is incorrect and incomplete.",
